👋 Welcome to the "WebdriverIO Development Environment" in GitHub Codespaces!

🛠️  Your environment is fully setup with all the required software, so you can start making changes to the package files and test them.

🔦 There is a sample standalone script you can run via: '$ node ./examples/standalone/sample.js'

🔦 If you want to test changes for the testrunner (e.g. using Mocha), run:
    $ cd ./examples/wdio
    $ npm run test:mocha

🚀 Once the process in the terminals finish, following environments are available for you:
    - Preview of the documentation page:
        Open the port forwarded URL labeled with "Project Documentation".

    - Code Coverage Overview:
        Open the port forwarded URL labeled with "Code Coverage Site".
