        It is essential for us to be able to reproduce the bug on our own machines.
        Please either create a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
        in a [new repository](https://github.com/new), a [gist](https://gist.github.com/)
        or copy and paste all necessary files in here.

        > **What happens if you skip this step?** Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you, but it‚Äôs unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually, the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

        Please remember that:

        - Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
        - The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
        - You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

        Thanks for helping us help you!
