- Features:
  - Increased modularization
      - Page object structure leveraging return of landing page instances on navigation to pages
        - Isolates step definition files and page object classes from dependencies on downstream pages.
        - No need to import each page class that will be navigated to. 
        - Increases the modularity of the framework and enforces guardrails on methods defined within a page
        - Implicitly validates having landed on the correct page inside each page's constructor
          - Calls a method to validate some page indicator (e.g., title).
            - Parametrized with validation parameter to prevent page validation at compile time
          - Further enforces expected navigation results prior to interacting with a page's elements
        - Allows the framework to model the navigation structure of the application
        - Steps can traverse multiple pages using a single method.
      - Page Ui services separate from page objects
        - Model higher-level business logic
        - Page objects contain only DOM-level logic

      - Separation of validation and navigation logic
        - Collect artifacts for validation during navigation
        - Capture in validationOptions business option objects
        - Compare to expected values using subsequent validation steps
  - Use of Cucumber 'world' object with custom World constructor
