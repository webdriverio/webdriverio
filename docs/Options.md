WebdriverIO is not just a binding for the WebDriver protocol (like Selenium). It is a full test framework with numerous additional features and utilities. It is based on the [`webdriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver) package, which is a lightweight, non-opinionated implementation of the WebDriver specification including mobile commands supported by Appium.

WebdriverIO takes the protocol commands and creates smart user commands that makes using the protocol for test automation much easier.

WebdriverIO also enhances the WebDriver package with additional commands. They share the same set of options when run in a standalone script. But when testing starts from `@wdio/cli` (the WDIO testrunner), there are some additional options available for you to use in `browser.options`.

## WebDriver Options

The following options are defined:

### protocol
Protocol to use when communicating with the driver server.

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `http`

### hostname
Host of your driver server.

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `localhost`

### port
Port your driver server is on.

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `4444`

### path
Path to driver server endpoint.

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `/`

### queryParams
Query parameters that are propagated to the driver server.

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `null`

### user
Your cloud service username (only works for [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com), [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com), [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com), [CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com) or [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com) accounts). If set, WebdriverIO will automatically set connection options for you. If you don't use a cloud provider this can be used to authenticate any other WebDriver backend.

Type: `String`
Default: `null`

### key
Your cloud service access key or secret key (only works for [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com), [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com), [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com), [CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com) or [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com) accounts). If set, WebdriverIO will automatically set connection options for you. If you don't use a cloud provider this can be used to authenticate any other WebDriver backend.

Type: `String`
Default: `null`

### capabilities
Defines the capabilities you want to run in your WebDriver session. Check out the [WebDriver Protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#capabilities) for more details. If you run an older driver that doesn't support the WebDriver protocol, you’ll need to use the [JSONWireProtocol capabilities](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities) to successfully run a session.

Additionally, a useful utility is the Sauce Labs [Automated Test Configurator](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Platform+Configurator#/), which helps you create this object by clicking together your desired capabilities.

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `null`

**Example:**

```js
{
    browserName: 'chrome', // options: `firefox`, `chrome`, `opera`, `safari`
    browserVersion: '27.0', // browser version
    platformName: 'Windows 10' // OS platform
}
```

If you’re running web or native tests on mobile devices, `capabilities` differs from the WebDriver protocol. See the [Appium Docs](http://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps/) for more details.

### logLevel
Level of logging verbosity.

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `info`<br>
Options: `trace` | `debug` | `info` | `warn` | `error` | `silent`

### outputDir
Directory to store all testrunner log files (including reporter logs and `wdio` logs). If not set, all logs are streamed to `stdout`. Since most reporters are made to log to `stdout`, it is recommended to only use this option for specific reporters where it makes more sense to push report into a file (like the `junit` reporter, for example).

When running in standalone mode, the only log generated by WebdriverIO will be the `wdio` log.

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `null`

### connectionRetryTimeout
Timeout for any WebDriver request to a driver or grid.

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `120000`

### connectionRetryCount
Maximum count of request retries to the Selenium server.

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `3`

### agent
Allows you to use a custom` http`/`https`/`http2` [agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got#agent) to make requests.

Type: `Object`<br>
Default:

```js
{
    http: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
    https: new https.Agent({ keepAlive: true })
}
```

### headers
Specify custom `headers` to pass into every request.

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `{}`

### transformRequest
Function intercepting [HTTP request options](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#options) before a WebDriver request is made

Type: `(RequestOptions) => RequestOptions`<br>
Default: *none*

### transformResponse
Function intercepting HTTP response objects after a WebDriver response has arrived. The function is passed the original response object as the first and the corresponding `RequestOptions` as the second argument.

Type: `(Response, RequestOptions) => Response`<br>
Default: *none*

### strictSSL
Whether it does not require SSL certificate to be valid.
It can be set via an environment variables as `STRICT_SSL` or `strict_ssl`.

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

---

## WebdriverIO

The following options can be used with WebdriverIO in standalone as well as using the `@wdio/cli` testrunner.

### automationProtocol

Define the protocol you want to use for your browser automation. Currently only [`webdriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver) and [`devtools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devtools) are supported, as these are the main browser automation technologies available.

If you want to automate the browser using `devtools`, make sure you have the NPM package installed (`$ npm install --save-dev devtools`).

Type: `String`
Default: `webdriver`

### baseUrl
Shorten `url` command calls by setting a base URL.
- If your `url` parameter starts with `/`, then `baseUrl` is prepended (except the `baseUrl` path, if it has one).
- If your `url` parameter starts without a scheme or `/` (like `some/path`), then the full `baseUrl` is prepended directly.

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `null`

### waitforTimeout
Default timeout for all `waitFor*` commands. (Note the lowercase `f` in the option name.) This timeout __only__ affects commands starting with `waitFor*` and their default wait time.

To increase the timeout for a _test_, please see the framework docs.

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `3000`

### waitforInterval
Default interval for all `waitFor*` commands to check if an expected state (e.g., visibility) has been changed.

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `500`

### region
If running on Sauce Labs, you can choose to run tests between different datacenters: US or EU.
To change your region to EU, add `region: 'eu'` to your config.

__Note:__ This only has an effect if you provide `user` and `key` options that are connected to your Sauce Labs account.

Type: `String`<br>
Default: `us`

*(only for vm and or em/simulators)*

### headless
Sauce Labs provides a [headless offering](https://saucelabs.com/products/web-testing/sauce-headless-testing) that allows you to run Chrome and Firefox tests headless.

__Note:__ This only has an effect if you provide `user` and `key` options that are connected to your Sauce Labs account.

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

*(only for VM or EM/simulators)*

Exclude specs from test execution.

Type: `String[]`<br>
Default: `[]`

### suites
An object describing various of suites, which you can then specify with the `--suite` option on the `wdio` CLI.

Type: `Object`<br>
Default: `{}`

### capabilities

(It defaults to `0`, which runs all tests no matter what.) **Note:** Please be aware that when using a third party test runner (such as Mocha), additional configuration might be required.

Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `0` (don't bail; run all tests)

### specFileRetries
The number of times to retry an entire specfile when it fails as a whole.

Type: `Number`<br>

    'dot',
    'spec'
    ['junit', {
        outputDir: `${__dirname}/reports`,
        otherOption: 'foobar'
    }]
]
```

### reporterSyncInterval
Determines in which interval the reporter should check if they are synchronised if they report their logs asynchronously (e.g. if logs are streamed to a 3rd party vendor).

Type: `Number`<br>

Type: `String[]`
Default: `null`

## Hooks

WebdriverIO allows you to set hooks to trigger at specific times of the test lifecycle. This allows custom actions (e.g., take screenshot if a test fails).

Every hook has as parameter specific information about the lifecycle (i.e. information about the test suite or test). Read more about all hook properties in [our example config](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/examples/wdio.conf.js#L183-L326).
