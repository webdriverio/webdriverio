# Boilerplate Projects

Over the time our community has developed a bunch of boilerplate projects that can be used as inspiration to set up your own test suite.

## [amiya-pattnaik/ngtaf4js-boilerplate-cucumber](https://github.com/amiya-pattnaik/ngtaf4js-boilerplate-cucumber)

ngtaf4js-cucumber...This repository contains a collection of sample webdriverIO (Selenium - Node.js/JavaScript) projects and libraries that demonstrate how to use the tool and develop automation script using Cucumber BDD framework. It support ES6 (via babel-register) and uses Grunt to manage tasks. It generate Spec, JUNIT (html view on local machine through junit-viewer), Allure, JSON reporters as well.
