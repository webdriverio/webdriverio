 * The Fullscreen Window command invokes the window manager-specific “full screen” operation,

 * increases the window to the size of the physical display and can hide browser UI elements
 * such as toolbars.
 *
 * Note: this command was recently added to the official Webdriver protocol and might not be
 * working with current Selenium driver.
