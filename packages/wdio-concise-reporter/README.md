=====================

> A WebdriverIO plugin to report in concise style.

## Installation

The easiest way is to keep `@wdio/concise-reporter` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wdio/concise-reporter": "~0.0.1"
  }
}
```

You can simple do it by:

```

Instructions on how to install `WebdriverIO` can be found [here](http://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html).

## Configuration

The following code shows the default wdio test runner configuration. Just add `'concise'` as a reporter
to the array.

```js
// wdio.conf.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: ['dot', 'concise'],
  // ...
};
```
