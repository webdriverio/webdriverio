We are pleased to announce that a new major version of WebdriverIO finally got released. This has been more than one year in the making and I would never have thought that it would take so long but we finally can say that the new version of WebdriverIO is better than ever and ready for everyone to use. Over 800 commits had to be pushed from over [34 different contributors](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/graphs/contributors) and I am truely thankful to everyone who did partipate in this journey. With that being said...

When I started [one year ago](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/commit/e375d2e3a664da087a6494c3ae381f762031303a) to basically rewrite this project from scratch I knew that this would pay off because even though there will be problems here and there when upgrading from v4 to v5 I was confident that the WebdriverIO community in the support channels are gonna help themself out as they already do today.

## The Goal

Looking into the past of the project it is tremdous how big it has been grown within just a couple of years. From a handful of downloads a day to almost 50k and knowing that big companies are relying on this tool to ship their software on daily basis it became obvious that the next big feature has to be sustainability. The first step was made by [joining the JS.Foundation](https://twitter.com/webdriverio/status/908013968861655040) at the end of last year.

<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Proud to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/webdriverio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@webdriverio</a> is joining <a href="https://twitter.com/the_jsf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@the_jsf</a> to continue to grow as project and community üéâ üëè <a href="https://t.co/N58Iv5oC9r">https://t.co/N58Iv5oC9r</a></p>&mdash; WebdriverIO (@webdriverio) <a href="https://twitter.com/webdriverio/status/908013968861655040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">13. September 2017</a></blockquote><br>

After that the next step was to implement a technical infrastructure that would allow the project to grow. By looking at other successful open source projects (e.g. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) we adapted a monolithic project strutcture to simplify the process of contributing to WebdriverIO.<br>
<br>
We wanted to start this effort completely community driven and started to [get feedback](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues/2403) from everyone who was using WebdriverIO on daily basis. We created a [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webdriverio/v5) to be able to discuss architectural changes and organize the work of porting the packages into the new tech stack that was [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/).

## New Package Structure

As we moved to a monolithic system we scoped all WebdriverIO packages into the [`@wdio`](https://www.npmjs.com/org/wdio) NPM organization. This would make it simpler to onboard contributors to release new package versions and clarifies better which packages are "officially" maintained by the organization or are 3rd party community packages.<br>
<br>
If you have been using `wdio-mocha-framework` or `wdio-spec-reporter` in your project please update the packages to use the ones build for v5: `@wdio/mocha-framework` or `@wdio/spec-reporter`. The version number of all packages are from now on pinned to each other meaning that you should always have the same versions for all "official" WebdriverIO packages you use.

## We Did Some Spring Cleaning

When people proposed new commands to the API we contributors became more and more hesitent to introduce them due to the huge amount of commands that already existed. Many of these commands didn't provide any much differences from each other and maintaining them became a nightmare.<br>
<br>
Starting with v5 we created a "base" WebdriverIO package called [`webdriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver). It contains the bare logic to make HTTP request to a WebDriver endpoint and has all commands from [various specification](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/tree/master/packages/webdriver/protocol) (including the [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/) spec as well as Appiums [Mobile JSONWire protocol](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/mobile-spec/blob/master/spec-draft.md)) defined in a simple to maintain JSON object.<br>
<br>
As part of that effort we've renamed a lot of commands to align them to the pattern that has been used in the protocol. The base WebDriver client also now returns the `value` property of all protocol commands responses so that we were able to get rid of a lot of duplication (e.g. `title` and `getTitle` is now called `getCurrentTitle`).<br>
<br>
Additionally we have seen a lot of confusion around the WebdriverIO API and the fact that it sometimes takes selectors as first argument and sometimes not which made it really hard to e.g. build a consistent and useful TypeScript definition for it. In the new version __we got rid of selectors as command parameters__ and defined a set of commands only callable when using the browser/client instance or when using an element instance. In order to click on an element you now need to first fetch it to receive an element object and then call the click command on that instance, e.g.

```js
browser.click('#elem') // throws 'browser.click is not a function'

const elem = $('#elem')
elem.click() // clicks successfully on the element
// or
$('#elem').click()

elem.url('https://webdriver.io') // throws because the url command is scoped on the browser object
```

## Website Changes

We already had an automated system that generated the docs for our website. As part of the new architecture and tech stack we however ported this from [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).<br>
<br>
We are still in the process of finalising this effort as we want to continue providing you a way to simply [change the version](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues/3147) of the docs. We are also looking into [providing multiple translation](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues/3148) of the docs so that people who don't speak english can also understand and use WebdriverIO. Please reach out to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/webdriverio) or directly on the issue thread if you want to help us out here. It is probably one of the best ways to get involved into an open source project.

## How To Upgrade To v5

There are many more things that we have been working on over the last month that you might like to find out. Check out the official [changelog](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v500-2018-12-20) to find all changes that describe the new version. We might will update it over time since we couldn't keep a list of every detail that might have change. We would also like to ask you to have a look into the new [guide section](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html) and our updated docs in general.<br>
<br>
There is unfortunatelly no easy upgrade tool that you can download and run to update your test suites from v4 to v5 (even though we would love to have such a thing, PRs are welcome üòâ). If you run into any issues upgrading to v5 please join our support [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/webdriverio/webdriverio.svg)](https://gitter.im/webdriverio/webdriverio?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) and reach out to us.<br>
<br>
Every project is different so it is impossible to have one single guide to help upgrading all. However the following step by step description will give you at least close to where you need to go:<br>
<br>
- read the [changelog](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v500-2018-12-20) to understand all breaking changes
- remove all `wdio-*` and `webdriverio` packages from you `package.json`
- remove your `node_modules` directory
- install the new wdio testrunner: `$ npm install @wdio/cli --save-dev`
- if you have a `wdio.conf.js` in your root directory, create a backup: `$ cp wdio.conf.js wdio_backup.conf.js`
- rerun the configuration wizard: `$ ./node_modules/.bin/wdio config`
- merge custom modification on your old `wdio_backup.conf.js` into your new config file (don't merge everything at once, just start with the basic setup using no servives and just the e.g. spec reporter to run tests locally and work torwards a full migration)
- take the simplest test in your suite and rename the commands according to the changelog
- have your log directory set in your config (e.g. `logDir: __dirname`) to ensure you can see everything that is going on including errors (you can later set it to a proper log directory)
- try to run that first test suite you modified `$ ./node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.config.js --spec ./path/to/modified/test.js`
- take on the next test file and work your way through them
- add reporters and services back into your `wdio.conf.js` and see if they work as usual (__Note:__ it is possible that services or reporters that you have used aren't ported to v5 yet, if so please raise an issue in the repository if that community package or try to port it)

<br>Again, reach out in the support channel if you have issues porting your test suite. Chances are that we have missed to port a functionality that you have been using in your test. Thanks to the new project structure we can quickly fix this and provide an update version for you!<br>
<br>
We will release further blog article in our new blog with tutorials on how to upgrade WebdriverIO to v5 soon. You can also checkout the excellent [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO8xeC-w2Og&list=PL8HowI-L-3_9Ep7lxVrRDF-az5ku4sur_) from our beloved [Will Brock](https://twitter.com/willbrock) on the new release. An update to the [WebdriverIO Learning Course](https://learn.webdriver.io/) is also already in work.

## What Is Next

We didn't put so much work and love into this project to end it here. In fact we just get started. We truely believe that [WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/) is and always will be the automation standard of the industry. Therefor we are actively engaged in contributing to the standard to ensure that all commands are compliant to the protocols. We also take your common problems and general feedback back to the [W3C Working Groups](https://www.w3.org/testing/browser/) to ensure that we can address major issue at the core of the technology.

<br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To ensure that <a href="https://twitter.com/webdriverio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@webdriverio</a> is always conform to the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WebDriver?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WebDriver</a> standard it sends its representatives directly to the <a href="https://twitter.com/w3c?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@w3c</a> TPAC meetings so you can use the latest features as soon as they are available üôåüèª <a href="https://t.co/oJbHPn99Oc">pic.twitter.com/oJbHPn99Oc</a></p>&mdash; WebdriverIO (@webdriverio) <a href="https://twitter.com/webdriverio/status/1055813210480238593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">26. Oktober 2018</a></blockquote><br>

After the release we will be working on a detailed roadmap for the next year that allows you to participate in the progress and help us priorizing features.

## An Open Source Project Made With ‚ù§Ô∏è

Before I close up this blog post I want to address that WebdriverIO is an open source project maintained by dedicated people who love open source. A lot of times I get the feeling that people take this work for granted and forget that there are real humans spending their free time to provide some piece of software for everyone for free. As [@left_pad](https://twitter.com/left_pad) stated in the official Babel7 release:

<blockquote>"[...] I can only describe it as dread when seeing a message from someone online wondering why something hasn't been released while another asks why this bug isn't fixed yet. I want to just rush it out and be done with it but I also have a desire to take this seriously."</blockquote>

Please always be reminded that when you open an issue or ask for a feature that you are basically asking someone to spend his time on something to give you exactly that for free! Open source project can only work and survive if everyone participates and helps out with something. We are all humans and bugs happen, if you find them, please let us know in a way that we can easily work with the information and quickly fix it. It's even better if everyone once in a while takes sometime of his day to contribute back. We are maintaining [a list](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+pick%22) of well described issues that anyone can claim and start working on.<br>
<br>
Again, this project is not sponsored nor owned by any company. It is a collaborative effort of an inclusive community that loves to help each other out. Let's continue to stay exactly that!
