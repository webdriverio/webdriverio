## WebdriverIO, meet Serenity/JS!

Wouldn't it be great if you could use WebdriverIO to create full-stack test automation frameworks that interact with any interface of your system, generate in-depth reports, and help you write test code that's easy to understand, maintain, and reuse across projects and teams?

Now you can, thanks to [Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org)!

### About Serenity/JS

[Serenity/JS](https://serenity-js.org) is an open-source acceptance testing and integration framework, designed to help you achieve all that and more üöÄ

Serenity/JS provides [adapters](https://serenity-js.org/modules/) that make it easy to integrate your tests with [Web apps](https://serenity-js.org/modules/webdriverio/), [REST APIs](https://serenity-js.org/modules/rest/), [Node.js servers](https://serenity-js.org/modules/local-server/), and pretty much anything a Node.js program can talk to.

Thanks to Serenity/JS [Screenplay Pattern](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern.html), you and your team will also have a simple, consistent, and async-friendly [programming model](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/thinking-in-serenity-js/index.html) across all those interfaces.

Apart from integration with your system under test, Serenity/JS can also integrate with popular test runners such as [Cucumber](https://serenity-js.org/modules/cucumber/), [Jasmine](https://serenity-js.org/modules/jasmine/), [Mocha](https://serenity-js.org/modules/mocha/), [Protractor](https://serenity-js.org/modules/protractor/) and now also [WebdriverIO](https://serenity-js.org/modules/webdriverio/)!

Better yet, Serenity/JS provides a unique [reporting system](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/index.html) to help you generate consistent test execution and feature coverage reports and living documentation of your system across all its interfaces and across its various test suites.

### Thinking in Serenity/JS

The best way to get started with Serenity/JS is to follow our brand-new series of tutorials, where you'll learn how to build full-stack test automation frameworks from scratch.

Check out ["Thinking in Serenity/JS"](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/thinking-in-serenity-js/index.html) ü§ì

### Examples and project templates

If you prefer to kick the tires and jump straight into the code, you'll find [over a dozen example projects](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js/tree/master/examples) in the [Serenity/JS GitHub repository](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js) and plenty of code samples in our [API docs](https://serenity-js.org/modules/webdriverio/).

We've also created WebdriverIO + Serenity/JS project templates to help you get started with:
- [WebdriverIO, Serenity/JS and Cucumber](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-webdriverio-template/)
- [WebdriverIO, Serenity/JS and Mocha](https://github.com/serenity-js/serenity-js-mocha-webdriverio-template/)

All the above templates are configured to produce Serenity BDD reports, automatically capture screenshots upon test failure, and run in a Continuous Integration environment.

### Questions? Feedback? Ideas?

If you have questions about Serenity/JS or need guidance in getting started, join our friendly [Serenity/JS Community Chat channel](https://gitter.im/serenity-js/Lobby).

Enjoy Serenity!
