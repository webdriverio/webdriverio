Welcome to the WebdriverIO API docs. These pages contain reference materials for all implemented protocol bindings and convenience commands. Protocol commands, including [WebDriver](http://localhost:3000/docs/api/webdriver), [WebDriver Bidi](/docs/api/webdriverBidi) or mobile commands like [Appium](http://appium.io) are commands that are directly send to the underlying driver backend. Convenience commands provided by the [`browser`](/docs/browserobject), `element` or [`mock`](/docs/mocksandspies) object offer higher level interactivity.
