WebdriverIO allows using driver binaries directly instead of services.

Hereâ€™s an example with `geckodriver`.

### Download Geckodriver

**Note: You must have [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) installed to use Geckodriver.**

Download the latest version of `geckodriver` for your environment and unpack it in your project directory:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->
<!--Linux (64 bit)-->
```sh
$ curl -L https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.24.0/geckodriver-v0.24.0-linux64.tar.gz | tar xz
```
<!--MacOS (curl)-->
```sh
$ curl -L https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.24.0/geckodriver-v0.24.0-macos.tar.gz | tar xz
```
<!--MacOS (brew)-->
```sh
$ brew install geckodriver
```
<!--Windows (64 bit / Chocolatey)-->
```sh
$ choco install selenium-gecko-driver
```
<!--Windows (64 bit / Powershell)-->
```sh
# Run as privileged session. Right-click and set 'Run as Administrator'
# Use geckodriver-v0.24.0-win32.zip for 32 bit Windows
$url = "https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.24.0/geckodriver-v0.24.0-win64.zip"
$output = "geckodriver.zip" # will drop into current directory unless defined otherwise
$unzipped_file = "geckodriver" # will unzip to this folder name

# By default, Powershell uses TLS 1.0 the site security requires TLS 1.2
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

# Downloads Geckodriver
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $output

# Unzip Geckodriver
Expand-Archive $output -DestinationPath $unzipped_file
cd $unzipped_file

# Globally Set Geckodriver to PATH
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "$Env:Path;$pwd\geckodriver.exe", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
```

**Note:** Other `geckodriver` releases are available [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). In order to automate other browsers, you need different drivers. You can find a list with all drivers in the [`awesome-selenium`](https://github.com/christian-bromann/awesome-selenium#driver) README.

### Start Browser Driver

Start Geckodriver by running:

```sh
/path/to/binary/geckodriver --port 4444
```

For example, if you ran the `curl` command from above, you should have a `geckodriver` binary available in the current folder.

Start it like this:


```sh
./geckodriver --port 4444
```

This will start Geckodriver on `localhost:4444` with the WebDriver endpoint set to `/`.

Keep this running in the background and open a new terminal window. Next step is to download WebdriverIO via NPM:
