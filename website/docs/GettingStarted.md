Welcome to the WebdriverIO documentation. It will help you to get started fast. If you run into problems, you can find help and answers on our [Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/webdriverio/webdriverio) or you can hit me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/webdriverio).

:::info
These are the docs for the latest version (__>=7.x__) of WebdriverIO. If you are still using an older version, please visit the [old documentation websites](/versions)!
:::

## Installation

Use npm or Yarn to install the WebdriverIO test runner in your Node.js project. See [system requirements](#system-requirements).

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @wdio/cli
```

This single command downloads the WebdriverIO CLI tool that helps you set up WebdriverIO in your project.

## Set Up

Once you've installed the CLI you can bootstrap a _Hello World_ test suite into your project by running:

```bash
npx wdio config
```

![Set Up](../static/img/setup.gif)

This will prompt a set questions that guides you through the setup. You can pass a `--yes` parameter to pick a default set up which will use Mocha with Chrome using the [Page Object](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) pattern.

## Run Test

You can start your test suite by using the `run` command and pointing to the WebdriverIO config that you just created:

```bash
npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js
```

If you like to run specific test files you can add a `--spec` parameter:

```bash
npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --spec example.e2e.js
```

or define suites in your config file and run just the test files defined by in a suite:

```bash
npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --suite exampleSuiteName
```

## Run in a script

If you like to use WebdriverIO as an automation engine in a Node.JS script you can also directly install WebdriverIO and use it as package, e.g. to generate a screenshot of a website:

```js
const { remote } = require('webdriverio');

;(async () => {
    const browser = await remote({
        capabilities: {
            browserName: 'chrome'
        }
    })

    await browser.url('https://webdriver.io')

    const apiLink = await browser.$('=API')
    await apiLink.click()

    await browser.saveScreenshot('./screenshot.png')
    await browser.deleteSession()
})()
```

__Note:__ using WebdriverIO as a package requires handling asynchronous commands via `async/await`. Read more about this in our section on [Sync vs. Async](./SyncVsAsync.md).

## System Requirements

Youâ€™ll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed.

- Install at least v12.16.1 or higher as this is the oldest active LTS version
- Only releases that are or will become an LTS release are officially supported

If you don't have Node installed, we recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to assist managing multiple active Node.js versions. If you are using the [WDIO Testrunner](/docs/setuptypes#the-wdio-testrunner) in [sync mode](/docs/sync-vs-async#sync-mode) you also need Python v3 or higher installed.
