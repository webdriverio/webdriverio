title: Options
---

Based on the [setup type](./SetupTypes.md) (e.g. using the raw protocol bindings, WebdriverIO as standalone package or the WDIO testrunner) there is a different set of options available to control the environment.

## WebDriver Options

The following options are defined when using the [`webdriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver) protocol package:

### protocol
Protocol to use when communicating with the driver server.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `http`

### hostname
Host of your driver server.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `localhost`

### port
Port your driver server is on.

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `4444`

### path
Path to driver server endpoint.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `/`

### queryParams
Query parameters that are propagated to the driver server.

Type: `Object`<br />
Default: `null`

### user
Your cloud service username (only works for [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com), [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com), [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com), [CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com) or [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com) accounts). If set, WebdriverIO will automatically set connection options for you. If you don't use a cloud provider this can be used to authenticate any other WebDriver backend.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `null`

### key
Your cloud service access key or secret key (only works for [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com), [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com), [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com), [CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com) or [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com) accounts). If set, WebdriverIO will automatically set connection options for you. If you don't use a cloud provider this can be used to authenticate any other WebDriver backend.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `null`

### capabilities
Defines the capabilities you want to run in your WebDriver session. Check out the [WebDriver Protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#capabilities) for more details. If you run an older driver that doesn't support the WebDriver protocol, you’ll need to use the [JSONWireProtocol capabilities](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities) to successfully run a session.

Additionally, a useful utility is the Sauce Labs [Automated Test Configurator](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Platform+Configurator#/), which helps you create this object by clicking together your desired capabilities.

Type: `Object`<br />
Default: `null`

**Example:**

```js
{
    browserName: 'chrome', // options: `firefox`, `chrome`, `opera`, `safari`
    browserVersion: '27.0', // browser version
    platformName: 'Windows 10' // OS platform
}
```

If you’re running web or native tests on mobile devices, `capabilities` differs from the WebDriver protocol. See the [Appium Docs](http://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps/) for more details.

### logLevel
Level of logging verbosity.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `info`<br />
Options: `trace` | `debug` | `info` | `warn` | `error` | `silent`

### outputDir
Directory to store all testrunner log files (including reporter logs and `wdio` logs). If not set, all logs are streamed to `stdout`. Since most reporters are made to log to `stdout`, it is recommended to only use this option for specific reporters where it makes more sense to push report into a file (like the `junit` reporter, for example).

When running in standalone mode, the only log generated by WebdriverIO will be the `wdio` log.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `null`

### connectionRetryTimeout
Timeout for any WebDriver request to a driver or grid.

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `120000`

### connectionRetryCount
Maximum count of request retries to the Selenium server.

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `3`

### agent
Allows you to use a custom` http`/`https`/`http2` [agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got#agent) to make requests.

Type: `Object`<br />
Default:

```js
{
    http: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
    https: new https.Agent({ keepAlive: true })
}
```

### headers
Specify custom `headers` to pass into every request.

Type: `Object`<br />
Default: `{}`

### transformRequest
Function intercepting [HTTP request options](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got#options) before a WebDriver request is made

Type: `(RequestOptions) => RequestOptions`<br />
Default: *none*

### transformResponse
Function intercepting HTTP response objects after a WebDriver response has arrived. The function is passed the original response object as the first and the corresponding `RequestOptions` as the second argument.

Type: `(Response, RequestOptions) => Response`<br />
Default: *none*

### strictSSL
Whether it does not require SSL certificate to be valid.
It can be set via an environment variables as `STRICT_SSL` or `strict_ssl`.

Type: `Boolean`<br />
Default: `true`

---

## WebdriverIO

The following options (including the ones listed above) can be used with WebdriverIO in standalone:

### automationProtocol

Define the protocol you want to use for your browser automation. Currently only [`webdriver`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver) and [`devtools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devtools) are supported, as these are the main browser automation technologies available.

If you want to automate the browser using `devtools`, make sure you have the NPM package installed (`$ npm install --save-dev devtools`).

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `webdriver`

### baseUrl
Shorten `url` command calls by setting a base URL.
- If your `url` parameter starts with `/`, then `baseUrl` is prepended (except the `baseUrl` path, if it has one).
- If your `url` parameter starts without a scheme or `/` (like `some/path`), then the full `baseUrl` is prepended directly.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `null`

### waitforTimeout
Default timeout for all `waitFor*` commands. (Note the lowercase `f` in the option name.) This timeout __only__ affects commands starting with `waitFor*` and their default wait time.

To increase the timeout for a _test_, please see the framework docs.

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `3000`

### waitforInterval
Default interval for all `waitFor*` commands to check if an expected state (e.g., visibility) has been changed.

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `500`

### region
If running on Sauce Labs, you can choose to run tests between different datacenters: US or EU.
To change your region to EU, add `region: 'eu'` to your config.

__Note:__ This only has an effect if you provide `user` and `key` options that are connected to your Sauce Labs account.

Type: `String`<br />
Default: `us`

*(only for vm and or em/simulators)*

### headless
Sauce Labs provides a [headless offering](https://saucelabs.com/products/web-testing/sauce-headless-testing) that allows you to run Chrome and Firefox tests headless.

__Note:__ This only has an effect if you provide `user` and `key` options that are connected to your Sauce Labs account.

Type: `Boolean`<br />
Default: `false`

*(only for VM or EM/simulators)*

Default: `[]`

### exclude
Exclude specs from test execution.

Type: `String[]`<br />
Default: `[]`

### suites
An object describing various of suites, which you can then specify with the `--suite` option on the `wdio` CLI.

Type: `Object`<br />
Default: `{}`

### capabilities
The same as the `capabilities` section described above, except with the option to specify either a [`multiremote`](Multiremote.md) object, or multiple WebDriver sessions in an array for parallel execution.

### bail
If you want your test run to stop after a specific number of test failures, use `bail`.
(It defaults to `0`, which runs all tests no matter what.) **Note:** Please be aware that when using a third party test runner (such as Mocha), additional configuration might be required.

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `0` (don't bail; run all tests)

### specFileRetries
The number of times to retry an entire specfile when it fails as a whole.

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `0`

### specFileRetriesDelay

Default: `0`

### specFileRetriesDeferred
Whether or not retried specfiles should be retried immediately or deferred to the end of the queue.

Type: `Boolean`<br />
Default: `true`

### services

Default: `[]`

Example:
```js
reporters: [
    'dot',
    'spec'
    ['junit', {
        outputDir: `${__dirname}/reports`,
        otherOption: 'foobar'
    }]
]
```

### reporterSyncInterval
Determines in which interval the reporter should check if they are synchronized if they report their logs asynchronously (e.g. if logs are streamed to a 3rd party vendor).

Type: `Number`<br />
Default: `100` (ms)

### reporterSyncTimeout
Determines the maximum time reporters have to finish uploading all their logs until an error is being thrown by the testrunner.

Default: `5000` (ms)

### execArgv
Node arguments to specify when launching child processes.

Type: `String[]`
Default: `null`

## Hooks

The WDIO testrunner allows you to set hooks to be triggered at specific times of the test lifecycle. This allows custom actions (e.g. take screenshot if a test fails).

Every hook has as parameter specific information about the lifecycle (e.g. information about the test suite or test). Read more about all hook properties in [our example config](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/examples/wdio.conf.js#L183-L326).

__Note:__ Some hooks (`onPrepare`, `onWorkerStart` and `onComplete`) are executed in a different process and therefor can not share any global data with the other hooks that live in the worker process.

### onPrepare

Gets executed once before all workers get launched.

Parameters:
- `config` (`object`): WebdriverIO configuration object
- `param` (`object[]`): list of capabilities details

### onWorkerStart

Gets executed before a worker process is spawned and can be used to initialize specific service for that worker as well as modify runtime environments in an async fashion.

Parameters:
- `cid` (`string`): capability id (e.g 0-0)
- `caps` (`object`): containing capabilities for session that will be spawn in the worker
- `specs` (`string[]`): specs to be run in the worker process
- `args` (`object`): object that will be merged with the main configuration once worker is initialized
- `execArgv` (`string[]`): list of string arguments passed to the worker process

### beforeSession

Gets executed just before initializing the webdriver session and test framework. It allows you to manipulate configurations depending on the capability or spec.

Parameters:
- `config` (`object`): WebdriverIO configuration object
- `caps` (`object`): containing capabilities for session that will be spawn in the worker
- `specs` (`string[]`): specs to be run in the worker process

### before

Gets executed before test execution begins. At this point you can access to all global variables like `browser`. It is the perfect place to define custom commands.

Parameters:
- `caps` (`object`): containing capabilities for session that will be spawn in the worker
- `specs` (`string[]`): specs to be run in the worker process
- `browser` (`object`): instance of created browser/device session

### beforeSuite

Hook that gets executed before the suite starts

Parameters:
- `suite` (`object`): suite details

### beforeHook

Hook that gets executed _before_ a hook within the suite starts (e.g. runs before calling beforeEach in Mocha)

Parameters:
- `test` (`object`): test details
- `context` (`object`): test context
- `stepData` (`object`): step data (Cucumber only)
- `world` (`object`): world context (Cucumber only)

### afterHook

Hook that gets executed _after_ a hook within the suite ends (e.g. runs after calling afterEach in Mocha)

Parameters:
- `test` (`object`): test details
- `context` (`object`): test context
- `result` (`object`): hook result (contains `error`, `result`, `duration`, `passed`, `retries` properties)
- `stepData` (`object`): step data (Cucumber only)
- `world` (`object`): world context (Cucumber only)

### beforeTest

### beforeCommand

Runs before a WebdriverIO command gets executed.

Parameters:
- `commandName` (`string`): command name
- `args` (`*`): arguments that command would receive

### afterCommand

Runs after a WebdriverIO command gets executed.

Parameters:
- `commandName` (`string`): command name
- `args` (`*`): arguments that command would receive
- `result` (`number`): 0 - command success, 1 - command error
- `error` (`Error`): error object if any

### afterTest

Function to be executed after a test (in Mocha/Jasmine) ends.

Parameters:
- `test` (`object`): test details
- `context` (`object`): test context
- `result` (`object`): hook result (contains `error`, `result`, `duration`, `passed`, `retries` properties)

### afterSuite

- `caps` (`object`): containing capabilities for session that will be spawn in the worker
- `specs` (`string[]`): specs to be run in the worker process

### onComplete

Gets executed after all workers got shut down and the process is about to exit. An error thrown in the onComplete hook will result in the test run failing.

Parameters:
- `exitCode` (`number`): 0 - success, 1 - fail
- `config` (`object`): WebdriverIO configuration object
- `caps` (`object`): containing capabilities for session that will be spawn in the worker
