title: TypeScript Setup
---

You can write tests using [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) to get auto-completion and type safety.

You will need [`typescript`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and [`ts-node`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) installed as `devDependencies`, via:

```bash npm2yarn
$ npm install typescript ts-node --save-dev
```

WebdriverIO will automatically detect if these dependencies are installed and will compile your config and tests for you. Ensure to have a `tsconfig.json` in the same directory as you WDIO config. If you need to configure how ts-node runs please use the environment variables for [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node#options) or use wdio config's [autoCompileOpts section](/docs/configurationfile).

## Configuration

You can provide custom `ts-node` options through the environment (by default it uses the tsconfig.json in the root relative to your wdio config if the file exists):

```sh
# run wdio testrunner with custom options
TS_NODE_PROJECT=./config/tsconfig.e2e.json TS_NODE_TYPE_CHECK=true wdio run wdio.conf.ts
```

The minimum TypeScript version is `v4.0.5`.

## Framework Setup

And your `tsconfig.json` needs the following:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["node", "@wdio/globals/types"]
    }
}
```

Please avoid importing `webdriverio` or `@wdio/sync` explicitly.
`WebdriverIO` and `WebDriver` types are accessible from anywhere once added to `types` in `tsconfig.json`. If you use additional WebdriverIO services, plugins or the `devtools` automation package, please also add them to the `types` list as many provide additional typings.

## Framework Types

Depending on the framework you use, you will need to add the types for that framework to your `tsconfig.json` types property, as well as install its type definitions. This is especially important if you want to have type support for the built-in assertion library [`expect-webdriverio`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect-webdriverio).

For instance, if you decide to use the Mocha framework, you need to install `@types/mocha` and add it like this to have all types globally available:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mocha"
  values={[
    {label: 'Mocha', value: 'mocha'},
    {label: 'Jasmine', value: 'jasmine'},
    {label: 'Cucumber', value: 'cucumber'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="mocha">

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["node", "@wdio/globals/types", "@wdio/mocha-framework"]
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jasmine">

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["node", "@wdio/globals/types", "@wdio/jasmine-framework"]
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cucumber">

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["node", "@wdio/globals/types", "@wdio/cucumber-framework"]
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Services

If you use services that add commands to the browser scope you also need to include these into your `tsconfig.json`. For example if you use the `@wdio/lighthouse-service` ensure that you add it to the `types` as well, e.g.:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": [
            "node",
            "@wdio/globals/types",
            "@wdio/mocha-framework",
            "@wdio/lighthouse-service"
        ]
    }
}
```

Adding services and reporters to your TypeScript config also strengthen the type safety of your WebdriverIO config file.

## Type Definitions

When running WebdriverIO commands all properties are usually typed so that you don't have to deal with importing additional types. However there are cases where you want to define variables upfront. To ensure that these are type safe you can use all types defined in the [`@wdio/types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wdio/types) package. For example if you like to define the remote option for `webdriverio` you can do:

```ts
import type { Options } from '@wdio/types'

const config: Options.WebdriverIO = {
    hostname: 'http://localhost',
    port: '4444' // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.ts(2322)
    capabilities: {
        browserName: 'chrome'
    }
}
```

## Missing Types

When using Node 20 or above, wdio runs ts-node with different settings as this is required in order to keep things running.
These settings can cause your custom types not to be loaded, if this happens there are a few ways you can fix this, of which the easiest I will show below.

Using ts-node's environment variables
```
TS_NODE_FILES=true wdio run ./wdio.conf.ts
```

Using tsconfig
```
{
  "ts-node": {
    "files": true
  },
}
```

For more information checkout the (ts-node documentation)[https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/troubleshooting#missing-types].

## Tips and Hints

### Compile & Lint

To be entirely safe, you may consider following the best practices: compile your code with TypeScript compiler (run `tsc` or `npx tsc`) and have [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin) running on [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/typicode/husky).
