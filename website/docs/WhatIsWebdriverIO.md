title: What is Webdriver.IO?
---

WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and flakiness test suite.

It is designed to be:

- __Extendable__ - Adding helper functions, or more complicated sets and combinations of existing commands is __simple__ and __really useful__
- __Compatible__ - WebdriverIO can be run on the [WebDriver Protocol](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/) for __true cross-browser testing__ as well as [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) for Chromium based automation using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).
- __Feature Rich__ - The huge variety of built-in and community plugins allows you to __easily integrate__ and __extend__ your setup to fulfill your requirements.

You can use WebdriverIO to automate:

- üåê <span>&nbsp;</span> __modern web applications__ written in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or other frontend frameworks
- üì± <span>&nbsp;</span> __hybrid__ or __native mobile applications__ running in an emulator/simulator or on a real device
- üíª <span>&nbsp;</span> __native desktop applications__ (e.g. written with Electron.js)

## Based on Web Standards

WebdriverIO leverages the power of the [WebDriver](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/) protocol that is developed and supported by all browser vendors and guarantees a true cross-browser testing experience. While other automation tools require you to download modified browser that aren't used by actual users or emulate user behavior by injecting JavaScript, WebdriverIO relies on a common agreed standard for automation that is [properly tested](https://wpt.fyi/results/webdriver/tests?label=experimental&label=master&aligned) and ensures compatibility for decades to come.

During the development of this automation standard the web has changed a lot and many of the requirements that developers have today to test their web application can not be fulfilled using WebDriver anymore. While some of the core contributor of this project help support the [next generation](https://github.com/w3c/webdriver-bidi) of the WebDriver protocol, WebdriverIO provides an alternative automation solution based on the [Chrome DevTools](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) protocol. This allows the user to seamlessly switch between conventional commands based on WebDriver and powerful browser interactions through [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).

Read more about the differences of these automation standards in the section on [Automation Protocols](./AutomationProtocols.md).

## True Open Source

As oppose to many automation tools in the ecosystem WebdriverIO is one of the last truly open source projects that is run by an open governance and owned by a non-profit entity called [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/). This legally binds the project to grow and be directed in the interest of all participants. The project team values openness and collaboration and is not driven by monetary interests.

This makes the project very independent in how it is being developed and where it is suppose to go. It allows us to provide a free 24/7 support in our [community channel](https://gitter.im/webdriverio/webdriverio) as we build a sustainable community that supports and learns from each other. Lastly it gives a lot of opportunities to the people that contribute and engage with the project due to its [open governance](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).
