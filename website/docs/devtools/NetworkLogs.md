Monitor and inspect all network activity during your tests. DevTools captures every HTTP request and response, giving you complete visibility into API calls, resource loading, and network timing - just like browser DevTools.

**What Gets Captured:**
- **Request details** - URL, method, headers, query parameters, request body
- **Response data** - Status code, response headers, response body, timing
- **Resource types** - XHR/Fetch requests, scripts, stylesheets, images, and more
- **Performance metrics** - Request timing, duration, and network waterfall

This is invaluable for debugging API issues, identifying slow requests, validating data payloads, and understanding your application's network behavior during tests.
