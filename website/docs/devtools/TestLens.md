TestLens provides intelligent code navigation between the DevTools UI and your test source files. Click on any test in the UI to jump directly to that test's definition in your code editor, complete with exact line numbers.

**How It Works:**
- **Visual test hierarchy** - See your test structure (suites, tests, scenarios) in a tree view
- **Source mapping** - Each test links to its exact location in your source files
- **One-click navigation** - Click any test to open it in your editor
- **Editor integration** - Works with popular code editors through file:line protocols

This seamless connection between UI and code speeds up debugging by eliminating manual code searching when investigating test failures.
