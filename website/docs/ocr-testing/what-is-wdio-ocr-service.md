Automated testing on mobile native apps and desktop sites can be particularly challenging when dealing with elements that lack unique identifiers. Standard [WebdriverIO selectors](https://webdriver.io/docs/selectors) may not always help you. Enter the world of the `@wdio/ocr-service`, a powerful service that leverages OCR ([Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)) to search, wait for, and interact with on-screen elements based on their **visible text**.

The following custom commands will be provided and added to the `browser/driver` object so you will get the right toolset to do your job.

-   [`await browser.ocrGetText`](./ocr-get-text.md)
-   [`await browser.ocrGetElementPositionByText`](./ocr-get-element-position-by-text.md)
-   [`await browser.ocrWaitForTextDisplayed`](./ocr-wait-for-text-displayed.md)
-   [`await browser.ocrClickOnText`](./ocr-click-on-text.md)
-   [`await browser.ocrSetValue`](./ocr-set-value.md)

### How does it work

This service will

1. create a screenshot of your screen/device. (If needed you can provide a haystack, which can be an element or a rectangle object, to pinpoint a specific area. See the documentation for each command.)
1. optimize the result for OCR by turning the screenshot into black/white with a high contrast screenshot (the high contrast is needed to prevent a lot of image background noise. This can be customized per command.)
1. uses [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) from [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js)/[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to get all text from the screen and highlight all found text on an image. It can support several languages which can be found [here.](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html)
1. uses Fuzzy Logic from [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) to find strings that are _approximately equal_ to a given pattern (rather than exactly). This means for example that the search value `Username` can also find the text `Usename` or vice versa.
1. Provide a cli wizzard (`npx ocr-service`) to validate your images and retrieve text through your terminal

It works with **ZERO** system dependencies (besides what WebdriverIO uses), but if needed it can also work with a local installation from [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/) which will reduce the execution time drastically! (See also the [Test Execution Optimization](#test-execution-optimization) on how to speed up your tests.)

:::caution Important
There are a variety of reasons you might not get good quality output from Tesseract. One of the biggest reasons that could be related to your app and this module could be the fact that there is no proper color distinction between the text that needs to be found and the background. For example, white text on a dark background can _easily_ be found, but light text on a white background or dark text on a dark background can hardly be found.
