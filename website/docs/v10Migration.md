title: From v9 to v10
---

## Node.js

WebdriverIO v10 requires Node.js 22.19.0 or later. Node.js 18 and 20 are no longer supported. CI covers Node.js 22, 24, and 26.

## Mocha

`@wdio/mocha-framework` and `@wdio/browser-runner` depend on [Mocha 12](https://mochajs.org/blog/mocha-12-rc-1/). Mocha 12 needs Node.js `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`, which is covered by the v10 floor of 22.19.0.

```diff
- mochaOpts: { compilers: ['ts:ts-node/register'] }
+ mochaOpts: { require: ['ts-node/register'] }
```

`mochaOpts.compilers` is gone. Mocha removed the long-deprecated `--compilers` flag, so leftover compiler mappings are ignored. Load transpilers or other setup files with `mochaOpts.require`.

Mocha 12 changes that can leak through `mochaOpts`:

- `grep` accepts modern RegExp flags.
- `ui` is still `bdd`, `tdd`, `qunit`, or `exports`. Custom interfaces should keep the `*-bdd`, `*-tdd`, or `*-qunit` suffix.
- `parallel` is still unsupported. WDIO owns spec parallelism; Mocha's worker pool will error if you enable it.

Mocha 12 is ESM-first (`"type": "module"`). Programmatic `require('mocha')` still works on Node 22 via `require(esm)`. The WDIO Mocha CLI (`wdio run … --mochaOpts.*`) is unchanged; Mocha's own CLI now uses `util.parseArgs` instead of yargs.

## Cucumber

`@wdio/cucumber-framework` depends on [`@cucumber/cucumber` 13](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#1300).

Cucumber 13 requires Node.js 22, 24, or 26 or later. It does not run on Node.js 20, 23, or 25. The framework package declares that same range, starting at the v10 floor of 22.19.0.

```diff
- cucumberOpts: { tagExpression: '@smoke' }
+ cucumberOpts: { tags: '@smoke' }
```

`tagExpression` is not aliased. Setting it throws, so a leftover filter cannot silently run every scenario.

Cucumber 13 no longer exports `Cli`. Programmatic runs go through `runCucumber` from `@cucumber/cucumber/api`, which is what the adapter already uses.

Other Cucumber 13 breaks (ambiguous formatter paths, parallel workers, `BeforeAll` / `AfterAll`) are described in [Cucumber's upgrade guide](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/UPGRADING.md#1300).
