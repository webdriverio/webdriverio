### Do I need to use a `save(Screen/Element/FullPageScreen)` methods when I want to run `check(Screen/Element/FullPageScreen)`?

No, you don't need to do this. The `check(Screen/Element/FullPageScreen)` will do this automatically for you.

### My visual tests fail with a difference, how can I update my baseline?

You can update the baseline images through the command line by adding the argument `--update-visual-baseline`. This will

-   automatically copy the actual take screenshot and put it in the baseline folder
-   if there are differences it will let the test pass because the baseline has been updated

**Usage:**

```sh
npm run test.local.desktop  --update-visual-baseline
```

When running logs info/debug mode you will see the following logs added

```logs
[0-0] ..............
[0-0] #####################################################################################
[0-0]  INFO:
[0-0]  Updated the actual image to

[0-0] #####################################################################################

### Installation of Canvas on Windows failed with Node-Gyp logs

If you encounter issues with Canvas installation on Windows due to Node-Gyp errors, please note that this applies only to Version 4 and lower. To avoid these issues, consider updating to Version 5 or higher, which does not have these dependencies and uses [Jimp](https://github.com/jimp-dev/jimp) for image processing.

If you still need to resolve the issues with Version 4, please check:

-   the Node Canvas section in the [Getting Started](/docs/visual-testing#system-requirements) guide
-   [this post](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2019/03/27/node-gyp-windows/) for Fixing Node-Gyp Issues on Windows. (Thanks to [IgorSasovets](https://github.com/IgorSasovets))
