Consulte nuestra [p√°gina OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/webdriverio) para obtener m√°s informaci√≥n sobre c√≥mo realizar donaciones al proyecto.

Gracias a todos los que van a donar o han donado dinero al colectivo y, por tanto, han apoyado el proyecto y a todos los que han contribuido a √©l. De verdad que significa mucho ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Pol√≠ticas de costes

Queremos ser transparentes en la forma en que aceptamos los gastos para el colectivo. Todo el mundo deber√≠a poder participar y enviar gastos para el desarrollo de determinadas funciones. Tambi√©n queremos retribuir a la comunidad permiti√©ndonos sufragar los gastos del evento. Los siguientes tipos de gastos podr√°n ser reembolsados con cargo al colectivo:

### Event Expenses

If you host an event that has a speaker talking about using WebdriverIO and it's features you can expense up to __$100__. Reimbursement requirements for event expenses include:

- You or the event account must share the project on social media (Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn) at least 3x
- The event page must have the WebdriverIO logo and a link to the project page in your meetup description
- You must use the funds for qualified event expenses such as food, beverage, room or equipment rental.
- You must submit receipts with your reimbursement request.

### Development Expenses

If you have done development work on any of the repositories within the GitHub WebdriverIO organisation you may reimburse up to __$1000__ if the following requirements are met:

- You must have submitted qualifying pull requests that have closed at least 10 issues that were labeled with [`Expensable üí∏`](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/labels/Expensable%20%F0%9F%92%B8)
- Every additional issue closed with that label can be expensed with $100
- You must submit links to all issues you‚Äôve closed due to your pull requests
- In order to close the ticket automatically, you must have one commit message with the Fix keyword. For example, Fix #1234 to close ticket #1234.
- Pull Requests must be merged by someone from the [core team](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/main/AUTHORS.md#tsc-technical-steering-committee). If there are several Pull Requests, the core team member either selects the most recent one or the best one - that‚Äôs up to them to decide what is best for the project.
- You must claim an [`Expensable üí∏`](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/labels/Expensable%20%F0%9F%92%B8) issue by commenting to the issue thread to ensure that no one else is working on the same issue.
- Anyone contributing to WebdriverIO is eligible to expense their work if the implemented features or bug fixes are not objectives of a commercial job.

### Travel Expenses

If you are a member of the [Technical Steering Committee team](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/main/AUTHORS.md#tsc-technical-steering-committee) you are eligible to expense flights and hotel accommodations for travel to conferences or meetups as part of a speaking engagement on WebdriverIO, not paid by the event itself or a company. You may expense up to $500. Reimbursement requirements for travel expenses include:

- You must send out a post from your main social media account (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn or personal blog) thanking all contributors of the collective after the event took place.
- You must use the funds for qualified travel expenses such as ground or air transportation to the event and hotel accomodations.
- You must submit receipts with your reimbursement request.
