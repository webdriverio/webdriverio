title: Become a WebdriverIO Sponsor
---

WebdriverIO is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain such a large ecosystem and develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the generous financial backing of our sponsors.

## How to Sponsor‚Äã
Sponsorships can be done via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/webdriverio), [Tidelift](enterprise) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/webdriverio). Invoices can be obtained via GitHub's payment system. Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in Sponsorship Tiers.

If you have questions regarding tiers, payment logistics, or sponsor exposure data, please reach out to [sponsor@webdriver.io](mailto:sponsor@webdriver.io).

## Sponsoring WebdriverIO as a Business‚Äã
Sponsoring WebdriverIO gives you great exposure through our website (60k+ page views per month) and GitHub project READMEs. In addition, supporting OSS improves the reputation of your brand, which is an important asset for any company that interacts with developers.

If you are using WebdriverIO to test a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor WebdriverIO's development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. The exposure and positive brand image in the WebdriverIO community also makes it easier to attract and recruit developers and QA engineers with WebdriverIO experience.

## Sponsoring Vue as an Individual‚Äã
If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using WebdriverIO, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying us coffee once in a while. Many of our team members accept sponsorships and donations via GitHub Sponsors.

You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor WebdriverIO as a business. This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact on the sustainability of OSS projects than individual donations, so you will help us much more if you succeed.
