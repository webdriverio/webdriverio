With WebdriverIO you can test not only web application in the browser but also other platforms such as:

- üì± mobile applications on iOS, Android or Tizen
- üñ•Ô∏è desktop applications on macOS or Windows
- üì∫ as well as TV apps for Roku, tvOS, Android TV and Samsung

We recommend to use [Appium](https://appium.io/) to help you facilitate these types of tests. You can get an overview on Appium on their [offical documentation page](https://appium.io/docs/en/2.0/intro/).

Setting up the right environment is not straight forward. Luckily the Appium ecosystem has great tooling around this to help you. To set-up one of the above environments, just run:

```sh
$ npx appium-installer
```

This will initiate the [appium-installer](https://github.com/AppiumTestDistribution/appium-installer) toolkit that guides you through the setup process.
