Unfortunately there is at the moment no stable driver for automating Windows applications. Even though Appium maintains a [Windows Driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-windows-driver) that is based on Microsoft's [WinAppDriver server](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver), we would not recommend using it given that Microsoft has stopped maintaining the server and there are a lot of [known bugs](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Amicrosoft%2FWinAppDriver+webdriverio&type=issues).

If anyone is aware of a way to automate Windows applications, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.webdriver.io).
