With WebdriverIO you can test not only web application in the browser but also other platforms such as:

- 📱 mobile applications on iOS, Android or Tizen
- 🖥️ desktop applications on macOS or Windows
- 📺 as well as TV apps for Roku, tvOS, Android TV and Samsung

We recommend to use [Appium](https://appium.io/) to help you facilitate these types of tests. You can get an overview on Appium on their [official documentation page](https://appium.io/docs/en/2.0/intro/).

Setting up the right environment is not straight forward. Luckily the Appium ecosystem has great tooling around this to help you. To set-up one of the above environments, just run:

```sh
$ npx appium-installer
```

这将启动 [Appium-installer](https://github.com/AppiumTestDistribution/appium-installer) 工具包，该工具包将指导您完成安装过程。
